You can achieve the single replica setup easily without using the above images like so:

version: '3'

services:
  mongo:
    container_name: mongo
    image: mongo:4
    command: --replSet rs0  # <--- this startup command enables the replicaset.
    ports:
      - '27017:27017'
      - '28017:28017'
    volumes:
      - ./data/mongo:/data/db
Then you need run the following once to start the replicaset:

docker-compose exec mongo mongo --eval "rs.initiate({_id: 'rs0', members: [{_id: 0, host: 'localhost:27017'}]});"
I don't think we would add the images directly in the documentation as they tailor to our specific testing needs. You can find some docs on them here:
