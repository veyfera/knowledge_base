Creating and Enabling a Static Swapfile
Tip
There is no reason you can't have both a swap partition and a swapfile. This is an easy way to add more swap without repartitioning.

First create and intialize the file to hold the swap. For example, to create a 4GB swapfile, you could use the command:

sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=4096 status=progress

Set the appropriate permissions on the file. It should be readable and writable only by root. This can be done with the command:

sudo chmod 600 /swapfile

Next we need to format and enable the swapfile:

sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile

In order to ensure that the swap is enabled at boot we can add an entry to /etc/fstab. You can add the line to fstab manually or using the command:

sudo bash -c "echo /swapfile none swap defaults 0 0 >> /etc/fstab"
